# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
Connected to Ethereum Network: Used Alchemy to interact with the Ethereum blockchain without running our own nodes.

Generated API Key: Created an API key on Alchemy to facilitate communication with the Sepolia test network.

Set Up Ethereum Account: Managed our Ethereum transactions through Metamask, a browser-based wallet.

Acquired Test Ether: Obtained test ETH from the Sepolia faucet to deploy our smart contract.

Deployed Smart Contract: Utilized Hardhat to compile, deploy, and test our smart contract, integrating with Metamask and Alchemy for seamless deployment.
